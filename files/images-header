# This file updated from a vml binary. Comments are not saved. Images are
# stored in the sorted by name order.

# Changes in an image controlled by the `change` array for any image.

# If `delete` present in changes, absent of the image in new (vml binary)
# images cause its deletion from this file.

# If `update-<field>` is present in changes, the field would be updated.

# If `update-all` is present in changes it will update all fields of the image.

# The `keep-<field>` used to keep the filed from updating if update-all
# present. Note, to keep any field, `keep-change` should also be present in
# change, otherwise `change` would be updated and then `keep-<field>` would be
# removed. For example to keep description from updating `change` could be set
# like this.
# change: ["update-all", "keep-description", "keep-change"]
