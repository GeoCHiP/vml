# This file updated from a vml binary. Comments are not saved. Images are
# stored in the sorted by name order.

# Changes in an image controlled by the `change` array for any image.

# If `delete` present in changes, absent of the image in new (vml binary)
# images cause its deletion from this file.

# If `update-<field>` is present in changes, the field would be updated.

# If `update-all` is present in changes it will update all fields of the image.

# The `keep-<field>` used to keep the filed from updating if update-all
# present. Note, to keep any field, `keep-change` should also be present in
# change, otherwise `change` would be updated and then `keep-<field>` would be
# removed. For example to keep description from updating `change` could be set
# like this.
# change: ["update-all", "keep-description", "keep-change"]

# Images identifies by name and stores the following data:
#  description - optional,
#  url - mandatory,
#  change: optional,
#  update-after-days: optional,
#
# For example:
# [alt]
# description = "ALT Linux Sisyphus"
# url = "http://ftp.altlinux.org/pub/distributions/ALTLinux/images/Sisyphus/cloud/alt-sisyphus-cloud-x86_64.qcow2"
# change = ["update-all", "delete", "keep-change", "keep-update-after-days"]
# update-after-days = 60
